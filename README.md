# Registration for Customers

Registration system for customers via HTML and Perl.

This project comprises a Perl script and an HTML form for customer registration.

The HTML form collects various personal details, including name, address, contact information, and a photo upload option.

The Perl script handles form submission, validating the input data for correctness. It checks for errors such as missing or invalid fields, formats, and file extensions. If errors are found, it displays detailed error messages.
Upon successful submission, it saves the uploaded photo and presents a confirmation page with the submitted information. Both the HTML form and Perl script are styled using CSS for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Overall, this system offers a comprehensive registration process with server-side validation and feedback.
